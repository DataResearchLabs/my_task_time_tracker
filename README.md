A free lean task time tracker with a simple UI and several reports.  Requires Microsoft Access 365.  Code is open-source.

Coming soon (code is mostly completed, add a few last minute cleanup features, then need to put in a few weeks of heavy documentation and training videos as I find time evenings and weekends).
